1. Cryptography is the process of encoding information so that it is unreadable to everyone but an authorized party, who usually possesses some
	kind of key needed to decode the data.
2. The main difference between asymmetric and symmetric encryption is the keys used. Symmetric uses the same key (which is ideally a secret) for
	both encryption and decryption while asymmetric algorithms use two keys. One key (the public key) is used for encrypting and a second key, the 
	private key, is used to decrypt.
3. A hash is a string or number of fixed length generated from a string of text that will vary wildly with changes in input. It should be impossible
	to turn a hash back into its input string.
4. A seed is a number used for initializing a pseudorandom number generator.
5. A keystore is a Java repository used to store private keys and security certificates.
6. The Android keystore provides access to special secure hardware for storing crypto keys. On the right hardware, keys can be generated and operate on data
	without ever leaving the hardware.
